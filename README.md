My project for Unit 1 APCSA.
# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - This asphalt art project was created in code.org which involves creating subclasses, algorithms, methods, and comments. The image that I chose to create was a dog. The dog was created on a 12x12 grid.

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - Two things about my project that I am proud of include the design of my project and the functionality. I think that the most important part of my project is how it works so I am mostly proud of that.

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - Something that I would like to improve or do differently if I had the opportunity to change something about my project is to maybe try the harder 32x32 grid for extra credit. I would also like to try to improve my skils and attempt to maybe go for a less simpler design.
